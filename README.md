Harmonic Table
==============

*The source code for the C-thru AXis controller, created in Java and Processing.*

To compile it, you will need to point to 4 JAR files:

+ Core.jar - included with [processing](http://processing.org/download/)
+ [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
+ [jmidireference](https://github.com/gmuller/jmidireference/downloads) - My own library for midi transforms
+ [rwmidi](https://github.com/gmuller/rwmidi/downloads) - including the modications that I made for sync

An example eclipse project is included. Add references to your local copies of those jars and run as an application.
I will include ivy or maven at some point in the future.
